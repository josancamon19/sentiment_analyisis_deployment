## Sentiment Analysis deployment

### Overview

In this project, I trained and deployed my own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon
SageMaker on AWS. This model was trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or
negative reviews). I built the model, deployed it, and created a gateway for accessing this model from a
website.

### Evaluation

The project was reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the deployment project rubric. Reviewed this rubric thoroughly,
and self-evaluate the project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric met the specifications.
